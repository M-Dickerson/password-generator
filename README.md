# Password Generator

## Description

The motivation and purpose for this project was to help the browser generate a password, based off criteria the user sets. It solves the problem of not having a working password generator. I learned a lot about windows prompts, alerts and confirmations. I also learned a lot about using the math command to randomize text and numbers.

## Usage
