# Password Generator

## Description

The motivation and purpose for this project was to help the browser generate a password based off criteria the user sets. It solves the problem of not having a working password generator. I learned a lot about windows prompts, alerts and confirmations. I also learned a lot about using the math command to randomize text and numbers.

## Usage

To start the password generator you first have to click the red button. After that, you follow the instructions given to you on the prompts and at the end the generator will give you your password!
